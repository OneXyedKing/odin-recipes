    <h6>Delicious Homemade Lasagna</h6>

    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch, 
        tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna 
        filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of 
        small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
        I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and 
        crusty garlic bread.</p>

    <p>Homemade lasagna isn't as hard to make as it seems. Don't be intimidated by all the
         layers of delicious italian flavour - try this homemade lasagna recipe today!</p>
